The description of all projects in the repository

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Conditional gradient" project solves constrained optimization problems using the Frankâ€“Wolfe algorithm. The user must enter a function, constraints, an initial point and, if necessary, adjust the values of epsilon, delta, and lambda. As a result, there can be two possible outcomes:
  1. A calculation error occurs in the simplex method, and therefore no optimal solution is found for the given problem.
  2. The program displays an additional window with a graph showing the points: the starting point, the candidate point, and the final point as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The "perfect_numbers" project calculate as many perfect numbers as the user enter on the console. However, the program can slow down a bit if the user wants to display quite many numbers.
