The description of all projects in the repository

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Conditional gradient" project solves constrained optimization problems using the Frank–Wolfe algorithm. The user must enter a function, constraints, an initial point and, if necessary, adjust the values of epsilon, delta, and lambda. As a result, there can be two possible outcomes:
  1. A calculation error occurs in the simplex method, and therefore no optimal solution is found for the given problem.
  2. The program displays an additional window with a graph showing the points: the starting point, the candidate point, and the final point as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The "perfect_numbers" project calculate as many perfect numbers as the user enter on the console. However, the program can slow down a bit if the user wants to display quite many numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The project “kMeans” implements the k-means clustering algorithm accordingly. The program requires Excel file with data, the desired number of clusters and a choice of metric (either Euclidean or Manhattan). If the input is valid, then scene changes and displays an animation of the clustering process. Below is the example of one clustering run:

The project “kMedoids” implements the k-medoids clustering algorithm. The program requires Excel file with data, the desired number of clusters and a choice of metric (either Euclidean or Manhattan). If the input is valid, then scene changes and displays an animation of the clustering process. Below is the example of one clustering run:

Note: before displaying an animation of the clustering process, columns need to be chosen to be showed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The project “Apriori” implements the Apriori algorithm. The program requires the maximum number of products allowed in a single transaction (note: a number between one and entered maximum will be granted), the minimal support, and the minimum confidence. If the input is valid, then Excel file with the results will be created, a success message window will appear, and the frequent sets will be displayed in the console.
